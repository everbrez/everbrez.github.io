机器学习有多种定义。

# Definition

Arthur Samuel 的定义(old, informal)

> the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Tom Mitchell 的定义

> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with repect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if it's performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

例如： 下棋
E: 与众多棋手下棋的经验
T: 下棋
P: 下一局赢的概率

通常，机器学习可以分成两大类：

1. 监督学习(supervised learning)
2. 无监督学习(unsupervised learning)

可以通俗地理解上面两个概念：
监督学习是在人或者其他的帮助下学习，无监督学习是让机器自己学习。
